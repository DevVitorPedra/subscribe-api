# 

A API created with nodejs, using Express, Axios and Nodemailer,
with PostgresSQL deployed with heroku cloud, using Sequelize ORM to coordinate queries and sanitize inputs.
The main idea was to create an automatic signup email handler, which can be implanted in many APP's

###Improvements
# {VSP}
# Subscribe API
A>PI designed to handle signup forms

```
